Homicide_Report_analysis

The Homicide Reports, 1980-2014 dataset is very large. In total, there are 638,454 instances of reported homicides. The dataset is a part of the Murder Accountability Project, which is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 and dedicated to educate Americans on the importance of accurately accounting for unsolved homicides within the United States.In our project, we have used the homicide dataset from 1980 to 2014 to predict the perpetrator's sex, age and race
In the dataset, there are 24 different variables.:
There is an ID field, which we won’t use because it isn’t needed.
There is an agency code, agency name, and agency type which are all categorical variables used to identify the agency that recorded and handled the homicide case.
There are also variables for City, State, Year, and Month which are also all categorical used to show location and time of the homicide report.
There are variables for all of the information of the victim such as victim sex, victim age, victim race, and victim ethnicity.These variables will be very informative for finding trends the targeted victims for homicide.
The variables used for information of both the victim and perpetrator are all categorical.

6. An interesting thing to note about the data on the perpetrator is that the only data we have are the instances of homicide that are solved.
7. We also have relationship variable which is categorical, weapon variable which is  also categorical.
8. Victim count variable which is numeric, and perpetrator count variable also numeric. There are sixteen different weapons that are categorized in the weapon variable. This can be a very interesting variable because the weapon used for murder may give clues as to whether the murder was pre-empted or not, which can potentially be used to determine whether there is a chance for another homicide.
